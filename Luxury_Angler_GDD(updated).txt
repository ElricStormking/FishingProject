2. CORE GAMEPLAY LOOP
---------------------

2.1 Main Game Loop Flowchart
The gameplay loop starts at the Title Screen and centers on the Boat Menu, where players choose actions: traveling to fishing spots, fishing, chatting, shopping, or managing inventory. Time and energy consumption tie into the day-night and weather systems. Players must return to the starting game port to access the Shop or sell Fish Cards from their boat’s fishtank.

Flowchart (simplified):
Title Screen -> Boat Menu (Time, Weather, Location Display)
  -> Travel -> Select Map (1 of 5) -> Select Spot (1 of 10) -> Arrive (Time +1h, Energy -2)
  -> Go Fishing -> Choose Mode: Story Mode or Quest Mode
    -> Select Map (Story Mode: Story maps; Quest Mode: Quest maps, excluding story basic fish map)
    -> Fishing (Cast, Lure, Reel; Time +30m, Energy -5)
      -> Success -> Collect Fish Card (if fishtank not full) -> Return to Boat Menu
      -> Fail -> Return to Boat Menu
  -> Go Cabin -> Cruise Cabin (Social Interactions) -> Return to Boat Menu
  -> Go Shop (Only at Starting Port) -> Shop Menu (Purchase Items) -> Return to Boat Menu
  -> Go Inventory -> Inventory (Manage Cards, Gear) -> Return to Boat Menu
  -> Return to Port (Time +1h, Energy -2) -> Sell Fish Cards -> Access Shop

2.2 Gameplay Loop Description
Players begin at the Title Screen, entering the Boat Menu after a tutorial or save load. The Boat Menu displays time (e.g., Dawn), weather (e.g., Sunny), and the boat’s current location (e.g., Starting Port or Map 3, Spot 7). From here, players can:
- **Travel**: Move between the starting port and 5 fishing maps, each with 10 unique spots (e.g., Coral Reef, Deep Trench). Travel takes 1 hour and 2 Energy.
- **Fish**: Choose between **Story Mode** or **Quest Mode**:
  - **Story Mode**: Access story-related maps with unique fish and challenges tied to the narrative.
  - **Quest Mode**: Access Quest maps (excluding the story's basic fish map) for skill honing or catching specific fish without impacting story progression.
- **Chat**: Interact socially with companions.
- **Shop**: Purchase items, but only when docked at the starting port.
- **Manage Inventory**: Craft or equip items.
When the fishtank is full, players must return to the port (1 hour, 2 Energy) to sell all Fish Cards and free up space. Actions advance time and consume energy, looping back to the Boat Menu.

4. FISHING SYSTEM
-----------------

4.1 Fishing Mechanics
The fishing process in *Luxury Angler* consists of three minigames: **Cast**, **Lure**, and **Reel-In**, influenced by player and fish attributes.
- **Visual**: A Fishing Rod and A lure will be shown always after entering Fishing process.

4.1.1 Cast Minigame
- **Description**: A timing-based minigame 
- **Gameplay**: A cast meter showing up and if player click inside a Accurate Section on the cast meter, the lure will be casted to a hotspot(large or rare fishes have higher chance to appear), but if player missed the accurate section, the lure will be casted to a normal spot.
- **Modifiers**: Player’s Cast Accuracy and Fish Detection attributes affect Accurate Section size and visibility.
- **Outcome**: Success proceeds to the **Lure** minigame; failure ends the attempt.
- **Visual**: Add the visual of a 2D fishing rod casting animation and after player click in the cast meter, a lure with fishing line is being thrown out toward the hotspot in the water. If the player clicked within the Accurate Section on the cast meter, The lure with fishing line will land in the hotspot in the water with a splash sound, otherwise if player failed to click within Accurate Section, the lure with fishing line will land outside hotspot.

4.1.2 Lure Minigame (Enhanced)
The **Lure** minigame involves a fish shadow approaching the lure, with players given 3 to 4 opportunities to hook the fish.

Create a Lure Simulation UI at upper right corner showing a lure's movement in the water. Fishes nearby will swim at the bottom of Lure Simulation UI. A fish interested will stop, bubbling, and observe the lure for 5 seconds if the lure is acting correctly according to the Lure control scheme, then it will decide to bite the hook. If a player fails the control scheme of that lure type, the observing fish will swim away. 

Regular Lure Control: If a player presses up(W in WASD control), the lure is swimming up quickly after a second, if a player press left or right (A or D in WASD), the lure is swimming upper right towards to boat(right side of the screen) for a second. All actions have 1 second cooldown.

- **Fish Shadow Mechanics**:
  - A shadow (small, medium, or large) swims toward the lure, indicating fish size/rarity.
  - Shadow behavior (circling, darting) reflects fish **Aggressiveness** and **Elusiveness**.

- **Luring Phases**:
  - Players have **3 to 4 opportunities** (phases) to hook the fish.
  - Each phase uses rhythm-based inputs specific to the lure (e.g., Pulse Tap for Spinner).
  - **Success**: Correct inputs keep the shadow close.
  - **Failure**: Mistakes make the shadow swim away; all failures pull the lure back.

- **Progressive Difficulty**:
  - Later phases are harder (tighter timing, complex sequences).
  - Scales with fish **Elusiveness** and player **Lure Success**.

- **Hooking the Fish**:
  - After successful phases, a final timed input hooks the fish.
  - **Feedback**: Splash (success) or thud (failure).

- **Attribute Integration**:
  - **Player Attributes**:
    - **Lure Success**: Eases input timing.
    - **Bite Rate**: May reduce phases needed.
  - **Fish Attributes**:
    - **Aggressiveness**: Faster shadow approach.
    - **Elusiveness**: Higher failure risk.

- **User Interface**:
  - **Shadow Interest Meter**: Visual gauge of fish interest.
  - **Input Prompts**: Guides for each phase.

- **Lure Types**
- Spinner: Pulse Tap.
- Soft Plastic: Drag and Pause.
- Fly: Swipe Flick Combo.
- Popper: Tap and Hold Burst.
- Spoon: Circular Trace.


4.1.3 Reel-In Minigame
- **Description**: Tension-based minigame with QTEs to reel in the fish.
- **Modifiers**: Player’s Tension Stability and Reel Speed affect difficulty.
- **Outcome**: Success yields rewards; failure loses the fish.
- **Visual**: A hooked struggling fish with fishing line tied to it with splashing water. The fish will quickly swim left and right randomly.
- **Meter**: A tension meter showing up, and player has to make sure the tension indicator doesn't reach the max of the tension meter or the fishline will snap. 
- **control**: mouse press will Reel a bit and result fish losing Stamina, the consumed stamina number will pop up from a struggle fish.
- **QTE control tie to Struggle**: A fish has chances to do 2 or 3 types of the 10 struggle ways. A QTE control needs to be input quickly, otherwise Tension Meter will suddenly increase to 90% max.
- **Fish Stamina** A fish stamina bar will show on the fish's top. Fish will do a struggle several times until its stamina reaches 0 and being pulled up by the player. 

- **Fish Struggle Styles** (Examples)
- Rapid Thrashing, Deep Dive, Long Sprint.
