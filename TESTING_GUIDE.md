## üêü Fish AI Behavior Testing

### Swimming State Observation
Watch fish behavior during fishing sessions:

- [ ] **IDLE (30%)** - Fish stays relatively still
- [ ] **PATROL (40%)** - Fish moves in patterns around the area
- [ ] **FEEDING (20%)** - Fish actively seeks and approaches bait
- [ ] **FLEEING (10%)** - Fish tries to escape when hooked

### Struggle Pattern Testing
Use the debug tool to test different struggle patterns:

- [ ] **Burst Patterns** - Sudden intensity spikes
- [ ] **Gradual Patterns** - Smooth intensity changes
- [ ] **Oscillating Patterns** - Regular up/down cycles
- [ ] **Chaotic Patterns** - Unpredictable variations

### Environmental Effects
Test how environment affects fish behavior:

- [ ] Time of day changes (Dawn, Morning, Noon, Evening, Night)
- [ ] Weather changes (Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy, Stormy)
- [ ] Location changes (different fishing areas)

---

## üéØ Advanced Testing

### Auto-Test Mode
- [ ] Enable Auto-Test in debug tool
- [ ] Observe continuous QTE testing
- [ ] Check statistics accumulation
- [ ] Verify all QTE types are tested

### Export Functionality
- [ ] Run several QTE tests
- [ ] Click "Export Data" button
- [ ] Verify CSV/JSON data export
- [ ] Check data includes all statistics

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Monitor frame rate during gameplay

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Server Won't Start:**
- Check if Node.js is installed: `node --version`
- Check if npm is installed: `npm --version`
- Try: `npm install` to reinstall dependencies
- Try: `npm run build` then `npm run preview`

**Game Won't Load:**
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Try different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Check if port 5173 is blocked by firewall

**QTE Debug Tool Won't Open:**
- Make sure you're in fishing mode first
- Try both F12 and Ctrl+Shift+Q
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Refresh page and try again

**QTEs Not Responding:**
- Check keyboard focus is on game window
- Try clicking on game area first
- Check if keys are working in other applications
- Try different keys if some don't work

### Debug Console Commands
Open browser console (F12) and try these:

```javascript
// Check game state
console.log(window.game);

// Check current scene
console.log(window.game.scene.getScene('GameScene'));

// Force open debug tool
window.game.scene.getScene('GameScene').qteDebugTool.show();
```
